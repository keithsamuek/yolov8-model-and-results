Procedure:
Annotate images using roboflow (train and test images)
export dataset in yolov8 format

paste google colab code into google colab
create .yaml file under /content in google colab (just paste .yaml file in github)
adjust yolov8 model to be used and epoch coefficient
model may take 1 hour or more to run
analyze results

如何評估模型:
Precision: The proportion of true positive detections out of all positive detections (true positives + false positives). High precision means few false positives.
Recall: The proportion of true positive detections out of all actual positives (true positives + false negatives). High recall means few false negatives.
Confidence Threshold: The minimum probability required for the model to consider a detection as positive. Lowering this threshold increases the number of detected objects but may introduce more false positives.

Key Terms in the Confusion Matrix:
True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive cases.
True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative cases.
False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted as positive (Type I error).
False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted as negative (Type II error).

These values can help with metric of accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score and specificity.

Results (8 graphs):
Training Losses:

Box Loss: Decreases steadily and stabilizes, showing a clear downward trend.
Classification Loss (cls_loss): Also decreases, with a smooth curve indicating effective learning.
DFL Loss (dfl_loss): Decreases similarly, indicating that the model is learning well across different loss components.
Validation Losses:

Box Loss: Decreases and stabilizes, mirroring the training loss trend.
Classification Loss: More fluctuations are observed here, but the overall trend is still downward.
DFL Loss: Decreases steadily.
Metrics:

Precision: Shows a steady increase, stabilizing around 0.8, indicating good positive predictive value.
Recall: Increases gradually, reaching about 0.5, indicating the model is getting better at detecting true positives.
mAP50: Increases steadily, stabilizing around 0.6, which is a good indicator of the model’s accuracy at a 50% IoU threshold.
mAP50-95: Shows a slower increase, stabilizing around 0.35, indicating performance across a range of IoU thresholds.

如何對照片進行預測等指令:
You can customize the prediction process by adjusting various parameters like confidence thresholds, IOU thresholds. There are many yolov8 models to choose from too.
